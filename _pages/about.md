I'm Peter Ullrich, an Elixir developer and bicycle activist living in Cologne, Germany. I studied Psychology and Computing Science at the University of Groningen, a [Top 100](https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/profile/facts-and-figures/position-international-rankings?lang=en#:~:text=In%20the%202021%20Subject%20rankings,and%20Social%20sciences%20(92).) University in [the Netherlands](https://goo.gl/maps/JKUhVqjQTfA17rFz5).

Since 2019, I work in Cologne, Germany, as a senior software engineer for [Studitemps](https://studitemps.de) where I build systems focused on student [temping](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/temping). I (try to) work according to [Domain-driven Design]() and [Test-driven Development]() principles, write 99% of my code in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), build frontends preferably with [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view), and attempt to apply my Psychology knowledge in the IT context.

My personal projects and side jobs include a time-capsule/mailing service [Letter to Yourself](https://lettertoyourself.com), a software solution for efficient decision making [DecisionMaker](https://decisionmaker.k-i-e.com), a YouTube channel focussed on sharing my learnings on software architecture and Elixir development [PeterAndCode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiKq_ns5yMQcmcSPS17q9jg/videos), diverse projects for the [ADFC Köln](https://kreisverbaende.adfc-nrw.de/kv-koeln/adfc-koeln-ev.html), a pro-bicycle club, including an overview of all traffic accidents in Cologne [Verkehrsunfälle Köln](https://verkehrsunfaelle.adfc.koeln/) and diverse data crawling scripts like [Dauerzählstellen Köln](https://github.com/PJUllrich/Dauerzaehlstellen-Koeln) and [Parkhausauslastung Köln](https://github.com/PJUllrich/Parkhausauslastung-Koeln).

In the past, I hosted the [Explain Blockchain](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/explain-blockchain/id1326636335) podcast, became a ConsenSys certified Solidity Developer, won the Blockchain Hackathon Groningen in [2017](https://www.groningenatwork.com/nieuws/twee-winnaars-van-blockchain-competitie-bekend) with the team from [Forus](https://forus.io/), came in second in [2018](https://www.rug.nl/news/2018/04/blockchain-hackathon_-turning-current-parking-policy-upside-down_?lang=en), and wrote my master thesis about [Blockchain in Education](https://fse.studenttheses.ub.rug.nl/17833/1/Masterthesis%20-%20Peter%20Ullrich%20-%20Blockchain%20in%20Education.pdf). I worked in South Africa as a high school teacher, traveled the west-coast of Africa on a motorcycle, and spoke at international conferences about topics like [Design Patterns in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsyjSW46TDg) and [Event Storming in Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBUoNRRhNic).
