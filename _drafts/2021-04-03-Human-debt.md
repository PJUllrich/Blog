Idea: Technical debt but for humans
building up human debt means neglecting the "storming", "forming" and "norming" phase of team building, but jumping to the "performing" phase right away.
It's missing the "training" part of making a horse ready for a competition (the performing phase).

Important: Be alert about conflicts, both intra-personal and interpersonal, so conflicts with others and conflicts with oneself.

It includes its team and the environment around the team. If the team is dysfunctional, the product will be so too. Possibly right away, most certainly in the long run. If the team is functional, but works in a dysfunctional environment, your product will become dysfunctional as well, since it misses its supporting structure.

Also: human debt is not only intra-team, but also inter-team, so with other teams. And it's also about the environment in which a team performs. Is that environment supporting, nurturing, allows mistakes, errors, and failures?

Neglecting the human debt will lead the team to become dysfunctional.
